//object oriented concept
//buliding block of the java
//1.inheritance
//2.polymorphism
//3.abstract class
//4.encapsulation
//5.class
//6.object
//class:java is class based.it contain logic of program.
//object:physical entity present memory 
//example.building plan...buliding blueprint is nothing but class
//every object occupies memory
//inheritance:father child relationship
//code of duplicatio removed by inheritance
//i.e same function in two or more class
//for the relationship between two class use extend keyword
//genereally make child class obj because easily use parent class functionality
//father of A is object class
//root class of java class is object class
//all class is child of the object class
//object class present in java.lang package
//types of inheritance
//five type of inheritance
//1.single level:one child with one parent
//2.multiple:multiple father have one child..it not support in the java..becoz if two parent have same function then child confuse which one take so ambiguity occur
//3.multilevel:A->B->C
//4.hierachy:one father have mutiple child
//5.hybrid:combination of three model...java not support hybrid inheritance becoz it not conatin multiple inheritance
//parent class which provide functionality
//child class aqiure functionality
